Interactive Design Models - React Three Fiber (IDM-R3F) is an example of an interactive 
web application for exploring an architectural design model. It uses React Three Fiber 
to bridge the gap between Three.js and React.

This repository is a part of this  [project](https://github.com/pw-sea-code/interactivedesignmodels), 
as an example using the React/React Three Fiber frameworks to create UI/interactive components.

## ðŸš€ Quickstart

### Cloning & Install
You can clone the examples to your local machine using the following commands (from within your desired directory):
```shell
$ git clone --no-checkout --depth=1 https://github.com/PW-SEA-CoDe/InteractiveDesignModels.git
$ cd InteractiveDesignModels
$ git checkout main -- examples
$ rm -rf .git
```

### Dependencies
Once cloned, you will need to install the dependencies. Make sure your working directory is the root of the example you are interested in, and then run the following command (subsituting ```npm``` for your favorite Node.js package manager):
```shell
$ npm install
```
This will reference the package-lock.json file to install all required dependencies. If you have any issues, please submit and issue or reach out for assistance.

###  Deployment & Testing
To deploy a testing environment using ```vite``` run:
```shell
$ npm run dev
```
This will deploy a local version of the web application and you should see the port listed in your terminal output with which to view your app.
Typically this will be http://localhost:XXXX/

To build your application for deployment, you can instead run:
```shell
$ npm run build
```
